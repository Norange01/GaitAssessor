# GaitAssessor: Device for Assessing Gait of Cerebral Palsy Patients
This repository, mainly the fourSensors folder, contains ESP32 firmware for calculating the angle between the dorsal surface of the foot and the anterior surface of the leg using two BNO055 sensors, and reporting the angle through serial communication. This group project was part of the IBEHS 3P04:Health Solutions Design Projects III: Analysis and Decision Making course at McMaster University. Feel free to check out our [demo video](https://youtu.be/ocvgvfC_OX0?si=oFKpZTnaacOh0KXu) and our [slides](https://nooralrajab.com/docs/GaitAssessorSlides.pdf).
